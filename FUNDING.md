# Funding the @dndhubs/domspec Project

The `@dndhubs/domspec` repository is an open-source project by DNDHUBS LIMITED, dedicated to creating a global standard for DOM API and web development taxonomy classification within the DNDHUBS ecosystem. To sustain and expand this initiative, we rely on the generosity of our community through sponsorships and donations. Your contributions help fund new taxonomy domains, tooling improvements, and community engagement, ensuring the project remains robust, accessible, and aligned with industry needs.

## How Funds Are Used
Donations are allocated to the following key areas:

- **New Taxonomy Domains**: Expanding support for emerging industries like IoT, blockchain, and quantum computing.
- **Community Engagement**: Hosting workshops, webinars, and documentation to onboard contributors and users.
- **Maintenance**: Covering costs for CI/CD pipelines, testing infrastructure, and repository hosting.
