/**
 * Union type representing LifecycleStateTaxonomy in the DOMSpec ecosystem.
 * This taxonomy defines the possible states of an adapter's lifecycle within the Trakfox ecosystem,
 * used for managing the lifecycle of integration adapters (e.g., connectors for APIs, databases, or external services).
 * It aligns with integration patterns and state management standards, ensuring consistent state tracking
 * across platforms like Trakfox, HealthOrb DHIS2, or DnDHubs.
 *
 * - 'uninitialized': The adapter has been instantiated but not yet initialized.
 *   Classifications: Initial state, aligns with state machine patterns (e.g., FSM, UML state diagrams).
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'uninitialized', camelCase: 'uninitializedState', snake_case: 'uninitialized_state', ALL_CAP: 'UNINITIALIZED', cache key: 'adapter:uninitialized:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'uninitialized-{adapterType}-{timestamp}' (kebab-case for database storage).
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'created'; used in adapter bootstrapping, e.g., Trakfox API connector setup or HealthOrb DHIS2 data source initialization.
 *   Example Usage: Initial state in Trakfox adapter creation before configuration is applied.
 *
 * - 'initializing': The adapter is undergoing initialization, loading configurations or dependencies.
 *   Classifications: Transitional state, aligns with async initialization patterns (e.g., Promise-based setups).
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'initializing', camelCase: 'initializingState', snake_case: 'initializing_state', ALL_CAP: 'INITIALIZING', cache key: 'adapter:initializing:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'initializing-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Used during setup of connectors in DnDHubs marketplace integrations or Trakfox plugin loading.
 *   Example Usage: POST /api/adapters/{adapterId}/initialize to trigger configuration loading.
 *
 * - 'initialized': The adapter has completed initialization and is ready to connect.
 *   Classifications: Stable state, aligns with ready-to-connect patterns in integration frameworks.
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'initialized', camelCase: 'initializedState', snake_case: 'initialized_state', ALL_CAP: 'INITIALIZED', cache key: 'adapter:initialized:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'initialized-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'ready'; used in Trakfox for pre-connection validation or HealthOrb DHIS2 sync preparation.
 *   Example Usage: GET /api/adapters/{adapterId}/status returning 'initialized' before connection.
 *
 * - 'connecting': The adapter is establishing a connection to the target system or service.
 *   Classifications: Transitional state, aligns with connection establishment protocols (e.g., TCP, WebSocket).
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'connecting', camelCase: 'connectingState', snake_case: 'connecting_state', ALL_CAP: 'CONNECTING', cache key: 'adapter:connecting:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'connecting-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Used in Trakfox for API connection attempts or DnDHubs real-time sync.
 *   Example Usage: WebSocket connection attempt in Trakfox real-time analytics dashboard.
 *
 * - 'connected': The adapter has successfully established a connection and is operational.
 *   Classifications: Stable state, aligns with active connection states in integration platforms.
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'connected', camelCase: 'connectedState', snake_case: 'connected_state', ALL_CAP: 'CONNECTED', cache key: 'adapter:connected:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'connected-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'active'; used in Trakfox for live API data streaming or HealthOrb DHIS2 data sync.
 *   Example Usage: POST /api/adapters/{adapterId}/data to send data through an active connection.
 *
 * - 'disconnecting': The adapter is in the process of terminating its connection.
 *   Classifications: Transitional state, aligns with graceful shutdown patterns.
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'disconnecting', camelCase: 'disconnectingState', snake_case: 'disconnecting_state', ALL_CAP: 'DISCONNECTING', cache key: 'adapter:disconnecting:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'disconnecting-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Used in Trakfox for planned disconnection or HealthOrb DHIS2 session termination.
 *   Example Usage: POST /api/adapters/{adapterId}/disconnect to initiate connection teardown.
 *
 * - 'disconnected': The adapter has terminated its connection and is no longer operational.
 *   Classifications: Stable state, aligns with idle or terminated states in integration frameworks.
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'disconnected', camelCase: 'disconnectedState', snake_case: 'disconnected_state', ALL_CAP: 'DISCONNECTED', cache key: 'adapter:disconnected:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'disconnected-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'inactive'; used in Trakfox for post-disconnection cleanup or DnDHubs adapter reset.
 *   Example Usage: GET /api/adapters/{adapterId}/status returning 'disconnected' after session end.
 *
 * - 'error': The adapter has encountered an error and is in a failed state.
 *   Classifications: Error state, aligns with error handling patterns in integration systems.
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'error', camelCase: 'errorState', snake_case: 'error_state', ALL_CAP: 'ERROR', cache key: 'adapter:error:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'error-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'failed'; used in Trakfox for logging connection failures or HealthOrb DHIS2 error reporting.
 *   Example Usage: Error logging in Trakfox when an API connection fails due to authentication issues.
 *
 * - 'disposed': The adapter has been permanently disposed and cannot be reused.
 *   Classifications: Terminal state, aligns with resource cleanup patterns (e.g., garbage collection).
 *   Identifiers: lowercase: 'disposed', camelCase: 'disposedState', snake_case: 'disposed_state', ALL_CAP: 'DISPOSED', cache key: 'adapter:disposed:adapterId'.
 *   Model Identifier Format: 'disposed-{adapterType}-{timestamp}'.
 *   Variations and Use Cases: Synonym: 'destroyed'; used in Trakfox for adapter cleanup or DnDHubs resource deallocation.
 *   Example Usage: DELETE /api/adapters/{adapterId} to remove an adapter instance after disposal.
